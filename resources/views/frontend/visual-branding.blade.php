            <p>What will flash through a lady’s mind when she thought of having a new hand bag, Louis Vuitton, Chanel,
                Prada or Gucci? Reason is simple, because these are branded goods. Therefore the brand itself tells its
                quality, uniqueness, value and status. What will you expect when you call their customer service? It
                must be a beautiful and professional voice in answering your call. What about walking into their
                showroom? Elegant, stylish, posh, luxury and grand. All these tell about a brand as though it is a
                person.</p>

            <p>When you think of home furnishing, IKEA will appear in your mind automatically. Why? Simply because of
                its brand that makes home furnishing products that are affordable to the many people by combining
                function, quality, design and value together. You may not buy from IKEA eventually but your mind would
                tell you to have a look first at IKEA, because you like their ideas, creativities, cozy comfort feeling
                that makes you wanted to buy. This is an example of a very successful branding.</p>

            <p>It is not perfect of having a strong corporate identity and branding but a weak visual identity, which
                we are to talk about now i.e. Visual Branding that enhances its brand identity and make it unique and
                easy to be identified. This is crucial for the success of a brand and business. </p>

            <h1 class="text-green">What is Visual Branding?</h1>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="{{asset('img/Programmer Needs-42.jpg')}}" class="img-full">
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Can you remember or recognize the logo of IKEA? What about McDonald’s? I bet you do, it is a big
                        letter “M” in yellow, easy to spot from a far and identify without hesitation. That’s visual
                        identity which we see its name, logo, font and color appeared on the logo. It tells the value
                        and
                        message a company intended to convey. In fact, the logo is a very important to a company and
                        must be
                        done by professional to come out one that suits your company’s identity, your expectations, your
                        style and culture. So, logo also serves as the first communication tool to engage your
                        customer.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4 class="text-orange">Is it important to have a strong visual identity?</h4>
                    <p>Of course it is. A child will tell you he wants a pair of sport shoes with a “right tick” or
                        “three
                        stripes”. He may insist on you to buy only this sport shoes instead of other brand. Why, because
                        the
                        brand awareness is well developed and it gives consumers a strong sense of reliability to the
                        shoes.
                        Then they will become your loyal customers and to the extent to advertise for you, sharing with
                        friends about the shoes. To some, they will just have a moment of feeling proud when putting
                        them
                        on, a connection is built. Are you convinced now by the power of visual branding?</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2 class="text-orange">Brand Consistency</h2>
            <p>After building a visual identity, we need to focus on the brand consistency to make the visual branding
                alive and continue to stay alive. All correspondence materials, for example letter head, envelopes,
                signatures, stationaries and all advertising materials like signage must be consistent all across. Don’t
                you ever think it is a small matter to use a different shade of color for your logo. A customer may
                mistake it as a scam or even doubt the genuineness of the product. A loyal customer will spot the
                difference and start to question about the quality of your products. Therefore, brand consistency is
                also very important to your brand image</p>
