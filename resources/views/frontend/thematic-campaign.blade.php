            <h2>Business is hard to come by and the competition in the market is heightened. A company couldn’t afford
                to remain idle but to initiate a marketing plan that is effective to reach the targeted audiences.</h2>

            <p>One of the effective ways is to hold a thematic campaign. I am pretty sure you have seen some of these
                thematic campaigns, for example one of the largest online marketplace 11 Street Malaysia. It used a
                series of video commercials to tell a love story starring by Korean superstar Lee Min Ho and Malaysia
                actress Emily Chan.How does a love story relate to 11 Street? That is using a metaphor of finding true
                love to find what you love on 11 Street. The audience loved it and the effect was awesome, because it is
                liken to watching a Korean drama.</p>

            <p>This is what Thematic Campaign all about, a series of conceptualized advertising activities i.e. the
                press, radio, TV, events and all other materials tell a consistent story that flows in one direction
                with one clear objective to hit the bull’s-eye. This is a fantastic way to create awareness and attract
                new customers especially you are about to launch a new product or to lead a sales campaign. </p>

                    <h4>Looking back your past marketing activities. </h4>
                    <p>You might have experienced to run a thematic campaign or something similar in nature during some
                        festive seasons to boost sales but the result was not so encouraging.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>We could do a post-modem for you and review from all aspects.</h4>
                    <p>To find out the loophole that caused the undesired outcome. Most of it was the theme itself was
                        not clear or sharp enough to catch attention from the audience. Another reason could be problem
                        during the implementation of the campaign, this is because to run a thematic campaign is never
                        easy, it involves a lot of tedious and tiring works, from the very beginning of brainstorming
                        for the best idea, planning, organizing and to the stage of execution, all stages must be well
                        managed and coordinated for reaching the goal. That is the reason a thematic campaign must be
                        run by professionals from head to toe in order to succeed.</p>
