    <p>CUBEevo Director, a young and talented artist of the company. He started the company with his partner
        in year 2007 without a single account in hand. But today, CUBEevo has transformed itself as a
        professional young advertising agency having numerous satisfied clients. Undoubtedly, the
        transformation was not easy, it was done in sweat and blood.</p>
    <p>He didn’t get the chance to be an intern, but he volunteered himself to work underpaid just to get
        real experience in advertising which was priceless to him. Therefore, the young talents who have
        infinite new ideas and creativity should be given a platform to showcase their capabilities.</p>
    <p>Thinking outside the box is not enough, tearing up the box is what he is looking out on the new born
        artists. Should you be one of them?</p>

    <p class="m-b-lg">Why do you look out for interns?<br/>
        Every individual is unique and special in their own ways. So as their ideas and creativity in their
        mind. They are fresh and we want new ideas. The world is moving so fast and one way to catch up with
        the latest trend is to get young, to know what the young people are thinking. They are the future
        leaders, so i must keep up with them to stay in the leading position.
    </p>
    <p class="m-b-lg">
        What qualities that are important to you?<br/>
        Hardwork beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard. So, to me, working attitude and the passion
        they have on what they are doing are very important. Besides, their personality and interpersonal
        skills are vital because teamwork is another key to success.
        Since we are in a designing industry, the skills in art and design are equally important. The
        potential, however could be discover later.
    </p>
    <p class="m-b-lg">
        Don’t you think it is a bit of wasting time and resources to guide them?<br/>
        That’s true. We practically hold their hands from a to z, coaching, guiding and sometimes solving
        their problems. But, sometimes it surprises me when they exchange different views which are useful
        and mind blowing. Talented people only come by chance, we need to give in order to reap.
    </p>
    <p class="m-b-lg">
        What would you hope to see in them after the completion of Internship?<br/>
        Like any parents do, to see them being independent in their own style and open minded when receiving
        criticism. Be honest and humble enough to continue learning from others.
        It’s our job and duty to make sure they improved after the completion of internship. The best is we
        are able to bring out the real potential in them which is beneficial for their future development.
        In short, i hope to see a transformed person.
    </p>
    <p class="m-b-lg">
        Would you keep them?<br/>
        Yes. Of course, provided they are fit to keep up with our team. Sometimes, we have crazy working
        hours and pressure, to be frank. So, come and join CUBEevo if you dare and ready to be transformed.
        CUBEevo has been recruiting interns since its establishment. The director and the team members are
        willing to share their experience with the young talents. So, drop us an email if you wish to be
        part of the young and talented team.
