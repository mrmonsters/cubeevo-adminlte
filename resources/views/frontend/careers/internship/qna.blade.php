                <p>Q: Why did you choose CUBEevo?<br/>
                    A: That’s true. We practically hold their hands from a to z, coaching, guiding and sometimes solving
                    their
                    problems. But, sometimes it surprises me when they exchange different views which are useful and
                    mind
                    blowing.</p><br/>

                <p>Q: Share about your first impression towards CUBEevo?<br/>
                    A: Like any parents do, to see them being independent in their own style and open minded when
                    receiving
                    criticism. Be honest and humble enough to continue learning from others. It’s our job and duty to
                    make sure
                    they improved after the completion of internship.</p><br/>

                <p>Q: What did you do in CUBEevo?<br/>
                    A: Yes. Of course, provided they are fit to keep up with our team. Sometimes, we have crazy working
                    hours
                    and pressure, to be frank.</p><br/>
