                    <p>Are you online? A common question asked in this digital and internet world. A life in internet
                        has made things moving very fast in every second 24/7 nonstop and it has changed the way we live
                        and do business drastically. To stay alive, we are bound to catch up with it or else we would be
                        left behind and worst, redundant.</p>

                    <p>The capability of Google and other search engines are improving daily enormously to provide
                        information and other useful services to the whole world. The world is changing even when we’re
                        sleeping, and Information is just a click away. With a smartphone at hand we can search,
                        communicate and receive information from around the globe. We must ride on the benefits it
                        provides and use it to our advantage. </p>

                    <p>Having a corporate website is better to have one billboard on highways now whereby online users
                        can obtain your company information much easier. People would like to know more about our
                        company before engaging business with us. The fastest way to get that is our company website
                        whereby our company profile, experiences, strengths and etc. are easily accessible. Surely, a
                        profound company website will help to lift up our company image and also serve as a good
                        advertising tool. Bear in mind, smart consumers now can simply find our competitors in just a
                        few seconds, by online.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes we prefer things that are simple and nice, perhaps precise. A microsite is a simplified
                        straightforward website specially caters for specific needs and very suitable for campaign
                        purpose. It can be either independent website or park under main corporate website. It provides
                        a platform for interaction with the targeted audience, for example to play a fun game or to get
                        a free gift by filling up questionnaire. This is very powerful tool to engage the audience to
                        know the brand. By having a microsite, you need to have a very specific goal in order to make it
                        achievable.</p>

                    <p>Why limit our business boundaries to a small regime where it could be widened through E-commerce?
                        We could trade countrywide or even worldwide with the present of the E-commerce facility
                        available now. This is mainly because the online world has changed the way we do shopping that
                        makes life more convenient and have more time to focus on more important things in life.</p>
                    <p>According to a marketing research done in US recently, about 40% of business is contributed by
                        E-Commerce and the figure is still counting and definitely growing. By adopting this idea of
                        doing business we have to reorganize our company’s structure and resources but we shall witness
                        a good return in terms of sales and to remain competitive in the market. The fact is this is a
                        great marketing tool which is more cost effective and efficient whereby human factors are
                        minimized, because we may not need a middleman or distributor to promote our products anymore.

            <p>You may have a company website already but is it useful or has it achieved the purpose you were intended?
                A website needs to be updated consistently to catch up with the ever changing business environment. It
                is a total meaningless website built in the jungle that people get lost in finding you. Therefore, for
                an effective website, the utmost important thing to do is to drive traffic via Search Engine
                Optimization (SEO) & Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Next is conversion by allowing your visitors to
                contact you and close the deal. Therefore, both SEO & SEM is very important to enable people to locate
                your website when they type a few keywords on the search bar.

                you have simple texts, an image, or a video to play. You are what you search, I know, it is terrifying.
                This is because Google knows who you are and what you like to see online. And hence Google will show an
                advertisement content that attracts the right person. However, we all know that GDN is only for
