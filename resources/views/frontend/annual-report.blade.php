            <h2>Each year an annual report comes out. You can picture what’s it like to read one. You have charts, graphs and, well, basically a record of what a company’s been doing for the past year. There’s only a number of printed annual reports that doesn’t trigger the yawn factor.
            </h2>
            <br/>
            <p>If you noticed, a lot of organizations are going digital with their annual reports. But that doesn’t mean that printed annual reports are now obsolete. There are still people like Warren Buffet, the third richest man on earth, who prefers the ‘old’ technology.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>So before you choose to go absolutely paperless, it’ll be wise to hear us out.</p>

            <h1 class="text-ashgreen">Why go digital with your annual report?</h1>
            <h2 class="text-brightred">Easy Access Broadens the Reach</h2>
            <p>People nowadays explore online information themselves from any location in the world. When you send printed annual reports, it only reaches the audience you chose. With the internet, anyone can casually skim it without being committed to reading it. You get to reach audiences that you never thought you had. Any casual reader has the potential to be your future stakeholder or shareholder. And what better way is there to find them than through the internet?</p>

                    <h2 class="text-brightred">Save on Printing Cost</h2>
                    <p>Let’s face it. A lot of people either skim through the report and toss it aside or completely ignores it. Only the keen readers take the time to read. So, it’ll be wise to observe what most companies are doing now. Some choose to have a digital version coupled with a printed version. Others only print out 2-4 pages report with a link to the full digital version.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Another clever way is to have a digital output first in the form of a website or downloadable PDF. Sending a printed version of an annual report only upon request not only saves you on the printing fees but it gives you bragging rights of being environmental friendly.</p>

            <h2 class="text-brightred">Helps Get the Important Data</h2>
            <p>Before digital, there was no data that can be collected to further improve with a paper copy. But when you put your report online, every PDF downloaded can be tracked. You get information like where and when it was distributed, which parts were the most viewed, most clicked and even, where people found out about your report and where they go after reading it. With these data in-hand, you know your audience a little bit better and make improvements to stay relevant and not off the mark of what your audience wants to see.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6  m-t-md">

                    <h2 class="text-brightred">More Appealing and More Space for Creative Content</h2>
                    <p>The sky’s the limit when you go digital. A digital annual report can be presented creatively in so many ways. You can include an interactive infographic, animation, videos or, for the more ambitious, make a microsite. But if that’s too much for you, a simple PDF can be eye catching. The beauty of an online PDF is space. You don’t have to worry about the printing cost. Space makes your information more readable and legible. And it’ll be more easily digestible for your readers. </p>

            <br/>
            <p>That said, you need to know whether going digital is the right communication tools for your audience. If you have a more elderly audience, then you should still have printed copies for them. If majority of your audience comes from a developing country where internet access is slow or limited, then by all means, use printed versions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Don’t assume that all digital annual reports saves money. As Bruce Trachtenberg said “What you save on paper and stamps you may pay in new technology costs.”</p>
